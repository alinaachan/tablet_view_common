            <h3>Geographical Location: South America</h3>
            <p>Machu Picchu is an ancient Incan citadel located in the Andes Mountains of Peru, South America. It is renowned for its breathtaking beauty, architectural ingenuity, and historical significance. Believed to have been built in the 15th century during the height of the Inca Empire, Machu Picchu served as a royal estate or religious retreat for the Incan ruler Pachacuti.</p>
            <p>Machu Picchu's remote location and mysterious abandonment in the decades following its construction have contributed to its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The site is characterized by its well-preserved stone structures, including temples, plazas, residential buildings, and intricate terraces carved into the mountainside. The precise construction methods used to build Machu Picchu without the use of mortar have puzzled archaeologists for decades. The entire complex is surrounded by stunning panoramic views of the surrounding valleys and mountains.</p>
